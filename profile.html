                    <p>Hi, this is Yagyesh Bobde! If you are reading this then you probably want to know a bit about me, right üí≠ So here is
                        the gist ‚¨áÔ∏è
                        I am currently in my 1st year of Engineering in Nagpur. <br>I am very passionate about creating and building things
                        on my
                        own ^_^ which is why I wanted to become an engineer in the first place. <br>I don't have a particular field set for
                        me, I am
                        always trying to learn new things while exploring all the available options, and sometimes these options are not
                        even
                        remotely close to engineering like trading & investing, blogging, content creation etc.</p>

                    I am currently focusing on web development using React js and MERN stack, I regularly take part in
                    competitions/hackathons and am always on the lookout for any other community programs that I can find. When I am not too
                    busy I try to trade in between my regular "schedule", you know "busy" student life, so that I can keep up with the news
                    in the financial world and also improve my trading skills. I also post blogs on a medium on a wide range of topics.
                    And actually, I recently started playing badmintonüè∏, 'cause you know exercising is important and there was no way I was
                    going to join a gym üòÇ
                    I did not know these were my interests right from the start ü§î, I mean no one ever does, you have to keep exploring, and
                    keep trying out new things until you find something that you will hold onto.
